TODO:
- practically remove all static variables since its 1. bad practice 2. a bad solution
- improve on the canvas sorting layers
- research a way to remove as much dependencies as possible
- DestroyOnInvisible on on big objects with a lot of children just isn't practical
- check if everything is frame independent
- polish the shop (maybe add short image descriptions to buttons?)
- bosses (enemies that spawn after a certain time (ex. 5 mins) and disable other enemy spawns after they're destroyed they drop gem currency)
- rework the main menu (on phone you probably dont use lmb to shoot lol)
- rework the speed, size of bullets
- change the structure (maybe the spaceshipcolors should inherit from spriteflasheffect)
- ship customization (different ship models)
- add new button animations (pointer down, pointer up)


Idk:
- add the focus mechanic (using the breaks slows down all enemies on screen and their bullets)
- add hitStop effects when got hit
- add a Time.timeScale controller script
- timed speed booster affectable item
- timed money booster affectable item

Not needed but yeayesyse:
- ignore input in game when clicked on UI

Android port:
- add gem currecy (added for killing specific enemies, surviving for a long time or getting an achievement)
- add cloud saving
- add a gem currency shop (customization purposes - colors, strobe lights, laser light, shoot origins, patterns, spaceship models (gotta have that millenium falcon ref lmao))

Misc:
- better timer code that allows for unidentifiable timers (the ones that are just created and never referenced)
- move back player sprite on shoot


DONE:
- make money visible in shop
- add icons to UI elements
- add a proper death screen when you don't have money for new upgrades
- add another parallax layer to the background (planets maybe?)
- better enemy AI to avoid them clumping together
- add last shop upgrade
- experiment with glow objects
- sound
- enhanced graphics a lil bit
- add a proper main menu to the game (re-spawn style)
- add a ui camera to disable pp effects on the interface
- add gameover sound
- upgrades are available sound
- check if music loops correctly
- remake random gen
- make social media buttons make a new browser tab
- make background particle effect
- pausing can't be on esc
- turn off debug stuff
- remake invincibility frames (make a new scrip for it)
- remake the yandere dev line (we all know what it is)
- new money script (spaceshipmoney.cs)
- change UI behaviour (make it possible for UI to be disabled and the game's behaviour not to change) currently the game is UI dependent 
- pause button
- add a third party color correction script to increase performance on mobile
- make a fake vigneete sprite
- made phone shooting
- the player can shoot backwards if enemies get very close to the spaceship
- fix the naming in the random gen system
- visual joystick movement
- auto shoot
- make a using breaks visible button
- check if all UI's scale correctly with different sizes
- fix the main menu bug where you can't set a camera to the canvas or it stops rendering (so weird lmao have trouble fixing)
- cursor became invisible after changing the canvas type to camera space (the problem was Z ordering)
- the UI should look for the player not the player for UI (removing dependencies #1 lmao)
- wave count on screen
- tween the entire UI
- rework the shop message (the shop messege is not correctly displayed, maybe even add a new tweening library)
- make health visible below the player (kinda done / still doesn't disapper when died and feels unpolished, thinking about a healthText below the player not a slider)
- global color manager
- color functionality for particle effects
- add button extentions
- added colorpick buttons
- implement the customization
- make the meteors in the menu a particle system
